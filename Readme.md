## Fetch API
The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).

## Promises
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

```javascript
fetch('URL')
.then(//do somethting)
.then(//do something);
```
